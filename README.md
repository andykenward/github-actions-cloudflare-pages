# Cloudflare Pages GitHub Action

This action deploys your build output to [Cloudflare Pages] using [Wrangler]. GitHub Environments and Deployments are used to track these deployments.

When used in context of a [pull request], the action will create a deployment for the pull request and add a comment with the URL of the deployment. On closing the [pull request], all the deployments for that pull request will be deleted from [Cloudflare Pages], GitHub Deployment and the related comment. **The action is only able to delete deployments & comments that it created, as it requires a certain payload in a GitHub deployment.**

- Deploy to [Cloudflare Pages].
- Use GitHub Environments & Deployments.
- Comment on pull requests with deployment URL.
- Delete Cloudflare Pages, GitHub deployments & comments, on pull request close.

## Comment Example

![pull request comment example](./docs/comment.png)

## Deleting Deployments

Deployments are only deleted when the GitHub Action Event triggered is `pull_request` and the event payload action is `closed`.

It will only delete deployments that it created for that pull request. This is because it requires a certain payload in a GitHub deployment response.

### GitHub Deployment payload example response

```json
{
  "payload": {
    "cloudflareId": "1234",
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "commentId": "1234"
  }
}
```
